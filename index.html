                    Accessibility measures improve the overall user experience for everyone, including individuals with disabilities. 
                    Clear navigation, proper color contrast, and readable content benefit all users by making the website or application
                    more intuitive and user-friendly.

                <p>
                    By implementing accessibility features, you ensure that your digital platforms can be accessed and used by a wider audience. 
                    This includes individuals with disabilities, seniors, and those using assistive technologies, allowing them to fully engage 
                    with your content and services.

                <p>
                    By adhering to accessibility guidelines and regulations, you ensure legal compliance and mitigate the risk of discrimination claims. 
                    Accessibility is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, and by proactively addressing accessibility, 
                    you create an inclusive environment and mitigate potential legal issues.

                <p>
                    Accessible design practices often align with search engine optimization (SEO) guidelines. 
                    Implementing accessibility features such as proper heading structure, alt text for images, and 
                    descriptive link text not only make your website more accessible but also improve its visibility and ranking in search engine results.

                        roles are used to give accessiblity tools information on what element does or what instead
                        function is supposed to be - aria should be used for the enhacement of accessiblity

                    </span>

                    <h4>
                        properties
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        these are almost similar to normal html attributes, they give more info on the element - properties should be used to complement
                        additional roles or native roles in elements
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        states
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        these give more info on the internal condition/state of an element ( eg: whether an element is disabled or readonly ) -  
                        states used for change or render-based stuff, states change but properties don't

                            always include text tracks for your video; whether they're captions, subtitles, descriptions, chapter markers or any others.
                            the benefit of text tracks can't be overemphasized -  they help screen readers, impaired people, people watching on low bandwidths..etc
